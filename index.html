            <h1>Make Your Own Hosted License</h1>

            <p>Do you also forget to add licenses to your projects or update it when the time comes? at least it happens to me a lot. So one day I was just looking for something that can help me with this and found out about <a href="https://github.com/remy/mit-license">MIT-License service by Remi</a>. Although, it originally serves my and many others basic needs but what if i need some license other then MIT?</p>

            <p>This site is just a test at this time, a work in progress and will be built from ground up as a fully automated system to create your own license pages. The idea is to make it as simple as doing a fork and changing your details but will completely depend on users feedback.</p>

            <p>Currently supports the following licenses:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="/mit">MIT License</a></li>
            </ul>

                <a href="https://github.com/meSingh/license">Fork this project to create your own hosted license page that you can always link to.</a>
