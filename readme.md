Do you also forget to add licenses to your projects or update it when the time comes? at least it happens to me a lot. So one day I was just looking for something that can help me with this and found out about [MIT-License service by Remi](https://github.com/remy/mit-license). Although, it originally serves my and many others basic needs but what if i need some license other then MIT?

This site is just a test at this time, a work in progress and will be built from ground up as a fully automated system to create your own license pages. The idea is to make it as simple as doing a fork and changing your details but will completely depend on users feedback.

Currently supports the following licenses:

* [MIT License](/mit)

[Fork this project to create your own hosted license page that you can always link to.](https://github.com/meSingh/license)
